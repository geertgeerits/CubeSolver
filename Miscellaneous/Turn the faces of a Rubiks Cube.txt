To make the faces of a Rubik's Cube turn in .NET MAUI, you would typically use a 3D graphics library to render the cube and apply transformations to rotate the faces. However, .NET MAUI does not currently have built-in support for 3D graphics.
You could use a platform-specific 3D graphics library, such as SceneKit on iOS or OpenGL on Android, but this would require writing platform-specific code and may not be ideal.
Another option is to use a cross-platform 3D graphics library that supports .NET, such as UrhoSharp. Here's a very basic example of how you might use UrhoSharp to create a cube and rotate it:


using Urho;
using Urho.Shapes;

public class MyApp : Application
{
    public MyApp(ApplicationOptions options) : base(options) { }

    protected override void Start()
    {
        base.Start();

        // Create a scene.
        var scene = new Scene();
        scene.CreateComponent<Octree>();

        // Create a node for the cube.
        var cubeNode = scene.CreateChild("Cube");
        cubeNode.Position = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
        cubeNode.Scale = new Vector3(1, 1, 1);

        // Create a Cube component for the node.
        var cube = cubeNode.CreateComponent<Box>();

        // Create a rotation animation.
        var rotate = new RotateBy(time: 1, deltaAngleX: 90, deltaAngleY: 0, deltaAngleZ: 0);
        cubeNode.RunActions(rotate);
    }
}


This code creates a cube and rotates it 90 degrees around the x-axis. You would need to extend this to create a full Rubik's Cube and implement the logic to rotate individual faces.
Please note that this is a very basic example and a real implementation would be much more complex. You would need to manage the state of the cube, handle user input to rotate faces, and possibly implement a solver algorithm.
